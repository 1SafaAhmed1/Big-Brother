Steps to create a branch, work on branch, commit, push branch, ask for pull
request on BitBucket, and finally delete branch.

// To create branch
1. git branch <branch name>

For example, if you want to create a branch called
introduction, you will use the command "git branch introduction" (quotes not included)

// For you to work on that branch, you must move into it
2. git checkout <branch name>

For example, if you want to move into the 'introduction' branch, you will
use the command "git checkout introduction" (quotes not included). Make sure 
current branch is showing 'introduction' and not 'master'.

// Any work you complete, you must commit on your local git.
3.1 git add .  //(This will add all files to be commited, notice the dot)
3.2 git commit -m "Appropriate Commit Message here"

// After your work is done in the branch, commit it, and you are finally
// ready to push it into online repository
4. git push

// After pushing, go to BitBucket, and open a pull request.
5. Open a pull request on BitBucket, mention your branch and submit.

I will review your branch code and decide if it ready to be merged or if it 
requires more work.
