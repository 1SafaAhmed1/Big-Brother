                        <p>The purpose of this document is to idenitfy the software
                        requirements of our product Big Brother, a student activity
                        monitoring app. This SRS will cover the principal functionalities
                        within our software that are required for a working prototype. We
                        will discuss the user interfaces of the system and its features.
                        Moreover, there will be discussion of the challenges we will
                        encounter in developing this system.</p>

                        <h4>Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
                        <p>This document is geared towards the developers of the
                        system and our project manager, who will ascertain the
                        validity of our project. Both the users and tester of systems
                        can also use this document to familiarize themselves and
                        recommend any relevent changes. It is susggested that any developers
                        or testers working with the system go through every section,
                        while the typical user of the system can get up and running
                        by reviewing section <i>2) Overall Description.</i>

                        <h4>Product Scope</h4>
                        <p> Big Brother is being developed with the idea of improving
                            educational outcomes in mind. Our system is classroom based where
                            teachers can assign reading materials to the students. In particular,
                            we hope to increase student participation by tracking certain activites
                            within the class. We will capture user data when a student open an
                            assigned PDF through methods such as eye tracking through the webcam
                            and time spent on a particular page.
                        </p>

                        <p> This will alow the teacher to optimize his/her resources in
                            assisting students. Furthermore, this will permit the teacher
                            to host online exam session without worrying about any
                            misconducts. By utilizing data driven technologies,
                            we will take the next step in educating students.

                        <h4>Product Perspective</h4>
                        <p>The current pandemic has compelled all educational facilities to shift
                            their organiziations from a physical to an online one. Hence, with
                            every passing day the demand for newer online features is rising.
                            Our aim for Big Brother is to create a new self contained product
                            to meet demands for this market.

                        <h4>Product Functions</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A teacher can add students to the class.</li>
                            <li>A teacher can share materials with the class.</li>
                            <li>The system can track student progress.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is a simple use case diagram designed to show the
                            functionalities:

                    <li>
                        <h4>User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
                        <p>
                            There are two assumed classes of users: teachers and
                            students. Both these classes of users are assumed to
                            be technologically literate. A teacher will have admin
                            or admin like privileges within the system, while
                            students will have limited interaction within the class.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Operating Environment</h4>
                        <p>Android application will require any Android based
                            phone. Furthermore, we will require that user be
                            on the latest Android Version (Android Version 11.0).
                        </p>
                        <p>On desktop, user must use a browser that supports video/audio streaming
                            to access the website.
                            Browser can include Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
                        </p>
                        <p>Since this is an internet based system, we will require
                            an internet connection. Furthermore, external peripherals
                            such as webcams and microphones are required.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
                        <p>The consumers of Big Brother will need to stay connected
                            to the internet. Furthermore, a student could deny access
                            to their webcam making tracking hard. The website must
                            satisfy older iterations of browsers, and must be able
                            to stream video/audio seamlessly across multiple versions
                            of multiple different browsers and Androids.
                        </p>

                        <h4>User Documentation</h4>
                        <p>We will be providing a seperate user manual and online
                            help section, to ensure our customers a simpler experience
                            of our system on both our webpage and Android Phone
                            application. The IEEE standard for Software User Documentation
                            format will be followed.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Assumptions and dependencies</h4>
                        <p>We plan to use eyetracking/webtracking and AI based
                            solutions through the use of open source API's such
                            as OpenAI and Google Vision. We assume they will be
                            freely available through the life cycle of our system
                            and will not undergo any change in policies. Change in
                            policies, such as the decision to make them private or
                            premium, will affect our service.

                        <p>This is a tentative look for website and app user interface and is subject to change. But it captures the general idea and purpose
                        of our app. User Interface must be compatible with touch screen.</p>

                        <h4>Hardware Interfaces</h4>
                        <p> Along side the usual mouse and keyboard for our website, touch screen will used in our Android application. Furthermore, webcam and microphone is a
                            necessity since they will be used to track students.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Software Interfaces</h4>
                        <p> The external software interfaces are handled through API's in our system.
                            We need machine learning and data collection API that are provided through
                            open source platforms such as OpenAI and Google Vision. Moreover, when
                            a user makes an announcement in the class, the notification is pushed
                            to a federated email.
                        </p>
                        <p>  Furthermore, we will use federated identity to create user accounts. Thus
                            any one of Facebook or Google account can be accessed by Django Allauth feature.

                        <p>
                            When a user makes a classroom announcement, a notification
                            is pushed through an email. Our system may also be required to
                            collect simple forms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TBD (More requirement needs to be researched on this point).

                                The teacher needs to log in first to add a
